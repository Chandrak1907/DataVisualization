        </div>


         <div class="contentTitle"><h2> Reason for chosing this dataset </h2>
           <p> This dataset contains below information regarding complaint received regarding a financial product:
Product, Sub Product, Issue, Subissue, State, Zipcode, Submitted via, Date Received, Date sent to company, Company, Company response, Timely response, Consumer Disputed </p>

Main reason for chosing this dataset is presence of State code and zip code. I want to derive some statistics (e.g. Total Number of complains received, Total number of complaints received per product ) from this data to plot on US map statewise, if possible at zip code level.
