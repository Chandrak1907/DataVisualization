        <div class="contentTitle"><h2>Planned Tools </h2>
          <ul>
            <li> I used R to pre-process dataset. </li>
            <li> I will also be using tool tip package in D3 (http://labratrevenge.com/d3-tip/javascripts/d3.tip.v0.6.3.js). </li>
           </ul> 
        </div>

         <div class="contentTitle"><h2>Planned Techniques </h2>
          There will be an option to chose type of complaint. For selected type, below will be plotted.
            <ul> 
              <li> Time Series Plot -  I will be plotting yearly trend of number of complaints . From this, trend of number of complaints over time for slected complaint type will be known</li>
              <li> Geo plot - On US Map, I will be plotting heat map of number of complaints  - From this, it is possible to identify which state is having more number of complaints for selected complaint type. </li>
              <li> Parallel plot of Statewise complaints data set </li>
              <li> Bubble plot of Credit card vs Mortage complaints with Debt collection complaints as radius of bubble. I want to see if there is any relationship between these three financial services (which are of similar type ) </li>

            </ul>
        </div>
         
         <div class="contentTitle"><h2>Planned Interaction</h2>
          <ul>
          <li> On time series plot, I will be implementing brushing, zooming and panning techniques. Time sereis interactions will not be linked to other plots</li>
          <li> On Bubble plot, I will implement tool tip functionality . </li>
          <li>  When a state is selected on geo plot, I will try to show only corresponding time series plot, parallel plot and highlight bubble in bubble plot. </li>
        </div>
